    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Pull Request 2924](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2924) in the EIP 1559 repo implements the transition period between the current \"legacy\" first-price auction-based fee market to 1559 as a soft opt-in for wallets and dapps. **Transactions sent in the legacy format** (with their `gas_price` attribute) **are converted to a 1559-compatible format** (with `gas_premium := max_fee := gas_price`).\n",
    "- We model the existing fee market where legacy users take price reference from **distributional oracles** to select their gas price. Their behaviour reproduces known patterns of **first-price auctions**: price stickiness and bubbles, due to the oracles' **reflexivity**. Oracles in this setting quote very different prices from the **market-clearing price**, which we estimate at each step.\n",
    "- On the other hand, **when 1559 users only transact, the oracles closely track the market price**, and more directly the basefee, which 1559 users take as reference to select their transaction parameters.\n",
    "- This implies that in a mixed regime with both 1559-adapted users (who look at the basefee) and legacy users (who look at price oracles), **the behaviour of 1559 users drives oracles closer to the true market price**. The effect is mixed for legacy users. Although they rely on more precise oracles, we find that their inclusion rates and delays are also worse than 1559-adapted users. Once 1559 is live, we suggest including the current basefee level in oracle estimations to ensure legacy users remain competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we model and simulate the transition period suggested in [Pull Request 2924](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2924). In this proposal, while 1559 transactions are expected, legacy-style transactions are still accepted by clients who convert them to 1559 format using default parameters based on the declared gas price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under EIP 1559, users are expected to quote their `gas_premium`, the maximum amount received by a miner who includes their transaction, as well as a `max_fee`, which caps the maximum price paid by the user. Meanwhile, current transactions (which we call \"legacy\" in this notebook) only declare a single `gas_price` parameter, which the user pays in all circumstances (see our general introduction to EIP 1559 and its changes to the existing fee market [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eip1559/eip1559.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Michał Komorowski analysed for Nethermind the impact of this transition period on the user behaviour [in a notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NethermindEth/research/blob/main/legacyTransactions.ipynb) using the abm1559 library. His takeaways include a comparison of the average fee paid by legacy users vs 1559 users, as well as their inclusion rates and eviction from the transaction pool. Notably, Michał ends with an important open question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `Percent of legacy vs. 1559 users` in the blocks diagrams show us that transactions submitted by all types of users are included in blocks when basefee reaches stablization. It's good. What is very interesting is the fact that around 40% of transactions in blocks (after stablization of basefee) are transactions submitted by naive users. I would expect more transactions from legacy or from clever users and I'm not sure how to exlain this behaviour. It is also worth pointing that in the in the beginning of the simulation, when basefee grows, mainly transactions of clever EIP-1559 users are included in blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make the hypothesis here that legacy users benefit from the actions of 1559 users, who implicitly align the oracles used by legacy users with the true market price, allowing all users to be included. In this notebook, we'll expand on this idea by comparing two boundary scenarios and their synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first import the classes from the [abm1559 library](https://github.com/barnabemonnot/abm1559) we'll use in this notebook. If this is your first notebook, you can also check out the [README](https://github.com/barnabemonnot/abm1559/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repo for installation details."

Although the behaviour of bots acting on behalf of MEV-chasing users is complex, involving bidding wars and real-time analysis of the transaction pool, we'll use a simple model of an extremely risk averse user who wants their transaction included at any cost (as long as it is lower than the value it can extract).\n",

    "\n",
    "Block space allocation is a dynamic process with a queue of users competing for scarce resources. Although first price auctions are an imprecise mechanism to allocate the resources to users efficiently, they provide an estimator of some true **market price**. We define market price as the actual gas price that ought to be quoted to exactly equalise demand with supply. How can we find it in our setting?\n",
    "\n",
    "We target the inclusion of some number of users $T$ in the block (recall that all users have the same, constant demand for gas). New users come in between each block, while the pool holds at most 10,000 unincluded users, ranked by their tip amount. Before a new block is created, we take a \"snapshot\" of the current state: a set of new users with values for gas $(v_i)_i$, and a set of pending transactions with gas prices $(g_j)_j$. We now sort the values and gas prices in decreasing order, obtaining a sequence of \"prices\" $(p_k)_k$. Taking $p_T$, the $T$-th price in the sequence, we estimate the true market price that equalises supply with the demand given the snapshot $(v, g)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two other ways to estimate the true market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Associate each transaction $j$ in the transaction pool with the user who sent it, and use the value of that user $v_j$ instead of the gas price $g_j$ of the transaction. This is likely a \"truer\" price of the current market, but it is also not a very useful one. There is nothing the user can do now that they sent their transaction in, so the market must decide to allocate space between existing transactions and the new users.\n",
    "2. Let new users post their transactions, record the gas prices $(g_i)_i$ of these new transactions and use that instead of the new users' values $(v_i)_i$. This price is the most concrete estimation of the realised market state, but may be biased towards the bidding strategies of new users, since the gas price is in general not equal to the user's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, we look for a value that answers the question: \"In a world where the market has full information about user values, which _uniform_ price should the market quote to equalise supply and demand?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We give in `get_market_price` the implementation of this estimator. Note that when we have less users and transactions than the target amount, the price is set to 0, since there is no scarcity. In practice, we could set this no-scarcity price to the minium fee miners expect from a transaction, although this makes no difference in the following."
